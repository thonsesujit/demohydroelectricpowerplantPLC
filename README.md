Hydroelectric Power plant demo project(Simulation via Siemens PLC Sim)
===============
The main motive behind this program is to demonstrate the PLC controllers functionality. Depending on the model of selected Programmable Logic Controller(PLC) from Siemens, we can program the PLC using 5 different programming languages, namely ‘Ladder Diagram(LAD)’ , ‘Functional Block Diagram(FBD)’ , ‘Structured Control Language(SCL) ‘, ‘Statement List(STL)’ and ‘S7-Graph’.
